# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.

This is Lindsay Bordelon's About Me and Portfolio page.
Screen 1 is an About Me section describing my background and current position.
Screen 2 is a Portfolio section showing a few images. These images will soon be replaced with completed projects.
Screen 3 is a Contact Me form page. This screen currently does not allow for true submission of contact info, but this will be corrected later.

I chose the theme of my Portfolio to compliment the terrazo background. I enjoy the calm and balanced color scheme.
